# Heart_Disease_Prediction_app
This project aims to develop a **web application** that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease. The app will gather user-provided information about their health and lifestyle factors and employ a trained machine learning model to assess their risk of heart disease. The app will provide users with personalized insights and recommendations to help them manage their heart health and reduce their risk of heart disease.

## Features 
- User-friendly interface for easy data input and result interpretation.
- Machine learning-powered prediction using trained models.
- Personalized risk assessment based on individual health factors.   
- Recommendations for heart disease prevention.

## Technologies
The project will be developed using the following technologies: 

- Python for back-end development.  
- Streamlit for front-end development. 
- Machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- Heart disease dataset from a reputable source.

## Installation
 Clone the repository to your local machine.
 
**Install the required dependencies using pip**.

## Usage
- Access the app in your web browser by navigating to **http://localhost:8080: http://localhost:8080**
- Enter your health and lifestyle information into the provided fields.
- Click the **"Predict"** button to receive your personalized heart disease risk assessment.
- Review the recommendations for heart disease prevention.
